Elevatorplay
===========


Do you have slow dependency install time? Are you impatient wait for project build? Do you feel anxious while waiting for a long deploy to finish? Just sit back and listen to some smooth jazz while your terminal ticks away

*Note:* Only OS X and Linux are supported at the moment due to `afplay` (mac) and `mpg123` (anything else) being an implied dependency


### Installation

```
npm i -g elevatorplay
```

### Usage

```
elevatorplay npm i sleep 5
```
